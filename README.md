P6: A modern OpenGL Renderer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A fresh direction, a fresh start. I'm calling this P6 (yes, I'm a completely unimaginative sod).

Uses [tinyobjloader](http://syoyo.github.io/tinyobjloader/), [SOIL](http://lonesock.net/soil.html), [glew](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) and [glm](http://glm.g-truc.net/).

(c) Rohith Chandran. This is an extension of a class project I did when I was at the University of Pennsylvania, so parts (c) Liam Boone, who wrote the initial framework, from which this was originally forked.
